    NSolver.java - This program implements Newton's Method to approx the root
    of a functionin the form I(t)=0. It requires user defined methods for I(t) 
    and I'(t). It also requires that I'(t) != 0. 
    
#The default output answers approximates the solution of the function:
	
	This program will solve the equation I(t) = 1000[1-(1+t)^-30]-135000t.
