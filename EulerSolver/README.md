    EulerSolver.java - This class file implements Euler's Method to solve the differential equation mv'= m-kv|v| with initial conditionals v(0)= 8 m/s, and mass m = 0.11 kg.

#The output answers part (a) of the question:

#Output:
	At t = (0), v(0) = 8.0
	At t = (1), v(1) = 6.903636363636363
	At t = (2), v(2) = 5.836981463561232
	At t = (3), v(3) = 4.7950353679140365
	At t = (4), v(4) = 3.77323106940577
	At t = (5), v(5) = 2.7673451190364444
	At t = (6), v(6) = 1.7734211208403445
	At t = (7), v(7) = 0.787702898164267
	At t = (8), v(8) = -0.19342523975532655
	At t = (9), v(9) = -1.1734932639796436
	At t = (10), v(10) = -2.1559970575080176

#Part(b):

	The projectile reaches its maximum height and begins falling between time t=7 and t=8 when the approximate value of v'=(acceleration) changes from positive to negative. Therefore the nearest 10th of a second is (0.7).
